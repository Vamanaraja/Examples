        <h2>Reciepe Steps</h2>

        <ul class="ul2">



        
        <li>Marinate cleaned beef/mutton with ingredients listed under marination - chilly powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, aniseed powder and salt. Keep it aside for 30 minutes.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 01.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>Soak rice in water for 1 hr.</li><br>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp water and cook the meat in pressure cooker until meat is done. Usually it takes around 2-3 whistles.</li><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, you can start masala preparation. Grind the green chillies, ginger and garlic.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 02.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>Slice 4 onions. Heat 2 tbsp ghee in a wok. Saute these onions with salt until golden brown.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 03.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>Add grounded green chilli mix and saute it well.</li><br>
        <li>Add sliced tomatoes to it and saute until tomatoes are done.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 04.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>Mix the curd and cook for 2 -3 minutes.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 05.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>Saute the grated coconut until golden brown. Grind the coconut and ground cashew with some water and make it a good paste. Alternatively, I sometimes ground the cashew and fried coconut into fine powder, mix it with  water and make it a good paste. Add coconut cashew mix and then garam masala. Saute it well.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 06.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>Add cooked beef with the water (gravy) . Adjust salt. Water should be just enough to mix well with rice. Cook it for around 5 - 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 07.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>For rice preparation - Drain the water from the rice. Heat ghee in the pan/ cooker. Add turmeric powder, cinnamon, bay leaf, cardamom seeds, curry leaves, cloves, star anise and aniseeds.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 08.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>Once it is sauted well, add rice. Saute it till rice is crispy.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 09.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>Add 4 - 4 1/2 water to it with enough salt. Cover and cook until rice is done. Depending on the rice, you may need to add extra water as well. It would approximately take 15 minutes. Refer notes on tips to cook rice.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 10.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>For garnish - Thinly slice onions and deep fry it in ghee. Sprinkle salt and bit sugar. Roast cashews and raisins.</li><br>
        <li>** Never miss this step. Layer a pan / cooker with alternating layers of rice and the beef /mutton masala. Extract lemon juice. Add coriander leaves, mint leaves, lemon juice, 1 tsp ghee, fried onions, cashews and raisins at every layer.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 11.jpeg" width="450"><br>
        <li>Heat the layered biriyani for about 20 minutes. It is a good option to bake it as well. Rice and biriyani masala gets blended well with this. You need not add water since biriyani masala has good gravy content.</li><br>
        <li>Serve it with raitha, pickle and papad.</li><br>
        <img src="asssets/images/pic 12.jpeg" width="450"><br>

    </ul><br>

    <p id="para3">
         <strong>Notes :</strong>
             
      Cook Rice - While cooking rice, the moment you don't find any water at the top, switch off the pan.        But keep it closed for another 10 - 15 minutes. 
      By this time, water would be completely absorbed, and rice would be cooked. 
      Open the pan and fluff the rice otherwise, rice will get sticky towards down the pan.
